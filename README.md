# Career Guidance Discord Bot

## Project Overview
This project is a Discord-based career guidance bot developed using Python.  
The bot provides users with career and profession recommendations based on their interests, following the requirements defined in the technical specification.

---

## Technical Specification Based Approach
While creating the work plan, the technical specification was taken as the main reference.  
The project is designed to:
- Run on Discord
- Provide interest-based career recommendations
- Use Python as the main programming language
- Operate with a command-based interaction system

---

## Reusable Code from Previous Projects
Some parts of the project can be adapted from previous Discord bot projects, including:
- Basic Discord bot setup (`commands.Bot`, intents configuration)
- Command handling structure (`@bot.command()`)
- Token management using a `config.py` file
- Simple data structures such as dictionaries

These components are standard for Discord bots and do not require rewriting from scratch.

---

## Components to Be Developed from Scratch
The following parts are project-specific and must be written from scratch:
- Career and profession data definitions
- Interest-to-career matching logic
- Profession descriptions, required skills, and career paths
- User-facing message content and formatting
- Career guidance logic specific to this project

These components form the core functionality of the project.

## Areas Requiring External Assistance
Support or external resources may be required in the following areas:
- Advanced Discord API features (slash commands, buttons, dropdown menus)
- Improving user interaction and experience
- AI-based personalized career recommendations
- Structured data storage (JSON files or databases)

These areas involve more advanced technical concepts.

---

## Areas Manageable Independently
The following parts can be handled independently without external help:
- Basic Python programming
- Simple command-based bot features
- Text-based career recommendations
- Project documentation (README)
- Basic debugging and testing

---

## Conclusion
This README outlines the project structure based on the technical specification, clearly identifying reusable components, original development requirements, and areas where assistance may be needed.  
This approach ensures an organized and efficient development process.
